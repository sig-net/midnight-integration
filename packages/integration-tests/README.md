# Integration Tests — the generic signet-caller e2e

Everything that needs a **running stack** lives here — nowhere else in the
repo touches a network from tests. The pipeline has two halves:

- **Setup** (`src/setup/`, run by vitest **globalSetup** — see
  `vitest.config.ts`): environment preflight → MPC key derivation → the
  deployer dust preflight → zk-compile + deploy the signet contract →
  persist the fakenet hand-off values to `.env` (append-only) + start the
  responder container → zk-compile + deploy the caller contract. Runs ONCE
  in vitest's main process before ANY test file, including single-file runs.
  Every step skips itself when its env var is already set (the hand-off
  steps: when the values are already in `.env` / the responder already runs
  with them). The pipeline is deliberately **EVM-free**: the caller's
  request exists to be SIGNED, never broadcast, so no EVM chain, token, or
  funded derived accounts are involved.
- **The flow file** (`tests/signet-caller-e2e.test.ts`, `--bail 1`): one
  ordered pipeline whose tests run in source order and feed each other
  through module-scoped state —
  1. `submitSignatureRequest` — drive the caller contract's request circuit
     (contract-fixed minimal calldata) and read the request back MPC-style
     from the raw ledger.
  2. Golden notification — the submit registered a decodable
     `SignBidirectionalNotification` in the signet contract's registry, read
     by field position through the hand-composed descriptors, exactly as the
     MPC reads it.
  3. `pollSignatureResponse` — the fakenet's ECDSA response arrives on the
     signet contract and verifies against the caller's epsilon-derived
     account.
  4. `verifyResponse` — verify a Schnorr attestation in-circuit and consume
     the request. The fakenet only attests after observing a broadcast on
     the destination chain (a leg this generic exercise deliberately omits),
     so the attestation is signed in-test from the suite's shared
     `MPC_ROOT_KEY` — the same key material the fakenet holds.

The unit tests beside it (`tests/env-file.test.ts`, `tests/mpc-keys.test.ts`)
run offline under plain `yarn test`; the flow file gates itself with
`describe.skipIf(!process.env.RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS)`.

## Prerequisites

- **Local dev stack**: `docker compose up -d` at the repo root — Midnight
  (node :9944, indexer :8088, proof server :6300) plus the `evm` service
  (anvil, :8545). The tests never touch the EVM chain; the service exists
  because the fakenet responder's config requires a reachable EVM endpoint
  to boot (`FAKENET_EVM_RPC_URL`, defaulting to the in-network
  `http://evm:8545`).
- **compact compiler** on PATH, then `yarn install` + `yarn compile` from
  the root.
- For the signature-response leg: the fakenet MPC responder — the `fakenet`
  compose service (`ghcr.io/sig-net/fakenet:latest`, built from
  [sig-net/solana-signet-program](https://github.com/sig-net/solana-signet-program)).
  **The setup starts it for you**: right after deploying the signet contract
  it appends `MPC_ROOT_KEY` + `MIDNIGHT_SIGNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to `.env`
  (append-only — existing lines are never touched; a conflicting value is a
  hard error, never an overwrite) and runs the compose command below —
  `--force-recreate` only when the values newly landed in `.env`, plain
  `up -d` (a no-op on a running responder) otherwise. Set `FAKENET_MANAGED=0`
  to manage the responder yourself (e.g. responder development via
  `yarn response` in a solana-signet-program checkout). Manual commands:

  ```sh
  docker compose --profile fakenet up -d --force-recreate fakenet
  docker logs -f fakenet-responder     # responder log
  docker compose pull fakenet          # refresh :latest after a fakenet-v* release
  ```

  The container's config interpolates from the same repo-root `.env`
  (`MIDNIGHT_*`, `MPC_ROOT_KEY`, … with in-network defaults when unset), so
  pointing the stack at another environment is a `.env` change.

## Running

```sh
yarn test:integration-tests                        # from the repo root
yarn test:integration-tests:signet-caller-e2e      # just the caller flow file
```

Either way the globalSetup pipeline runs first — setup is never skipped by
narrowing the selection.

Every setup step is **skippable via `.env`**: when its variable is set, the
step verifies it and logs `SKIPPED`, so a populated `.env` goes straight to
the contract calls (~2 min total). Unset, the step does the work, prints
the value to save — and for the fakenet hand-off pair
(`MPC_ROOT_KEY` + `MIDNIGHT_SIGNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`) **appends it to
`.env` itself and starts the responder container**, so nothing blocks on a
human between deploy and the flow. A fresh deployment is ONE run:
globalSetup zk-compiles both contracts (~10+ min: background it), deploys
them, hands off to the responder mid-setup, and the flow file runs to the
end (4/4).

**Redeploying after a circuit change?** Comment out the contract-address
vars in `.env` (`MIDNIGHT_SIGNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`,
`MIDNIGHT_CALLER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`) and rerun — see the runbook in
[`../../.claude/skills/e2e/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/e2e/SKILL.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` | Opt-in gate (real env only, not `.env`); `test:integration-tests` sets it | unset (flow file skips) |
| `NETWORK_ID`, `MIDNIGHT_NODE_*` | Midnight endpoints (deploy-package config) | local stack defaults |
| `DEPLOYER_SEED` | Wallet that pays for deploys AND drives the caller's circuits | genesis seed `00…01` |
| `MIDNIGHT_SIGNET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `MIDNIGHT_CALLER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | Deployed contracts; set to skip compile+deploy | deployed by setup (signet appended to `.env` automatically; caller printed — save it to skip redeploys) |
| `MPC_ROOT_KEY` | Fakenet signer root key | derived by setup, appended to `.env` |
| `MPC_JUBJUB_PK`, `MPC_SECP256K1_PUBKEY` | MPC public keys | derived from root key |
| `FAKENET_MANAGED` | `0` = setup neither writes the hand-off values to `.env` nor touches the responder container — you run the responder yourself (responder development) | unset (setup manages the responder) |
| `FAKENET_EVM_RPC_URL` | EVM endpoint as reachable from the fakenet CONTAINER (compose-only; not read by the tests) | `http://evm:8545` |
| `TRUST_PREBUILT_ZK_KEYS` | `1` = setup skips `compile:*:zk` when prover keys are already present. CI-only: the CI cache is keyed on the contract sources, so present ⇒ fresh; locally stale keys would poison deploys — never set it by hand | unset |
| `CALLER_REQUEST_ID` | Resume an in-flight request, skipping the (heavy) submit prove | unset |
| `STEP_THROUGH` | `1` pauses before each setup step and each test (hit enter) — interactive debugging only, never unattended | unset |

## Gotchas

- The signature-poll test timing out while everything else passes means the
  MPC responder is down or watching a stale signet contract address —
  `docker logs fakenet-responder`.
- Proof failures surface as `Failed Proof Server response … 400`; the real
  error is in `docker logs midnight-proof-server`.
- midnight-js persists private state in `midnight-level-db/` keyed by seed;
  `rm -rf midnight-level-db` resets it.
- In the `test:integration` script, `--bail 1` must stay LAST: the
  file-scoped script appends its `tests/<name>.test.ts` filter after it,
  and a trailing BOOLEAN flag (`--disable-console-intercept`) would swallow
  that filter as its value — vitest then silently runs EVERY test file.
